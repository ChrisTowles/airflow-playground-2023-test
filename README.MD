# Airflow Playground


This is a playground for Apache Airflow. The goal is to get more deep understanding of Airflow and its capabilities. I've played with Airflow in the past, but goal here is to get more hands-on experience with it.


## Tasks

- [ ] Airflow docker starting
- [ ] Postgres Database started
- [ ] Create a DAG that runs a Python function
- [ ] Create a DAG that reads table in Postgres
- [ ] Mock S3 with Minio or localstack
- [ ] Create a DAG that reads table in Postgres and outputs to S3


## Setup

- [Docker on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
  - https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user
